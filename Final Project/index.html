            <h2>About Novi Sad</h2>
            <br>
            <p>Welcome to Novi Sad, a city with an open heart, where 28 nations and nationalities live. A city of
                colorful
                cultures, customs and religion.
                <br>
                At the beginning of the 16th century, the first settlers built their huts on the site of today's town,
                not
                realizing that a large and prosperous town would eventually develop on that site. The first larger
                settlements were created thanks to the construction of the Petrovaradin fortress in 1692. Already in the
                middle of the 17th century, the city received great commercial and self-governing privileges, and by the
                charter of Maria Theresa in 1748, it was declared a free royal city, it received the coat of arms and
                the
                official name of Neoplanta, in Latin, that is, Novi Sad, in Serbian, which literally meant "young
                vineyard".
                . In the first half of the 19th century, Novi Sad grew into a city that many described as the most
                beautiful
                town on the lower Danube. The rise was tragically interrupted by revolutionary events in the middle of
                the
                19th century when the people of Novi Sad did not recognize Hungarian rule. On July 12, 1849, the
                Austrian
                army under the command of ban Jelačić opened cannon fire on the Petrovaradin fortress, where the
                Hungarian
                army was stationed, which bombarded Novi Sad with 200 cannons. Of about 2,800 houses, only 800 remain,
                and
                the population has decreased from 20,000 to 6,000. after the end of the rebellion, in 1852, the
                reconstruction of the city began. It took more than 20 years for Novi Sad to return to its pre-bombing
                condition. This national power reached its full strength and expression in the era of the Youth Movement
                and
                Miletic's struggle for national freedom, when Miletic called Novi Sad, the Athens of Serbia.
                <br>
                According to the last population census from 2011, over 250,000 inhabitants live in Novi Sad, while more
                than 340,000 inhabitants live in the administrative territory of the city of Novi Sad.

            <div class="container">
                <p class="mr-20">The oldest in the country, founded way back in 1861. In 1928, the theater burned down.
                    Since then, the
                    construction of the new building has been eagerly awaited. After 6 years of construction, it was
                    opened
                    in April 1981. The large hall has 940 seats, and the small hall has 373 seats. In front of the
                    building
                    there are monuments to Jovan Steria Popović and Pero Dobrinović</p>

            <h3>Freedom Square</h3>
            <br>
            <div class="container">
                <p class="mr-20">The heart of Novi Sad. On the site of the former Magistrate, the Town Hall was built
                    according to the
                    project of Đerđe Molnar in the Neo-Renaissance style in 1895, modeled after the town hall in Graz.
                    One
                    of the most impressive mayors was Svetozar Miletić, whose monument is located in the middle of the
                    square. With him, the national awakening of the city's consciousness began. His goal was to make
                    Novi
                    Sad a fortress for the defense of Serbia and to fight for the Serbian language to become official.
                    Therefore, it is very symbolic that his monument is located right here on the Square. He seems as if
                    he
                    has just stepped out of his house and started an energetic address to his citizens.</p>

                    Inside
                    the church, on the left side, there is a bust dedicated to Molnar, as well as beautiful stained

                    windows with family coats of arms and individual photos of the families that financed its
                    construction.
                    10 years after its construction, there was a fire, and then it received a roof made of žolnai
                    ceramics
                    from Pécs. The clock tower is 72m high. The windows are in the form of stained glass and there are

                    since
                    the middle of
                    the 18th century. Before it was embanked and houses made of hard material were built in it, there
                    was a
                    bridge on which there were small shops. Then it was called "On the bridge". For a while there was
                    also
                    Petrovaradinska Street, because the road to the Danube and the pontoon bridge for the crossing to
                    Petrovaradin went there. In the past, it was also called the Grand Canal of Novi Sad, due to
                    frequent
                    floods, because the water reached Vladičina dvor, creating a canal. After the restoration, it
                    experienced real splendor, and all prominent people from that time had at least one house in the
                    street,
                    as it was fondly called. Branislav Nušić (city library), Dunđerski, Laza Kostić, Svetozar Miletić,
